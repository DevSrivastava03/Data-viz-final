        In 2000, Faith Hill's <span class="hero-song">"Breathe"</span> finished the year as the top song on the
        Billboard Hot 100. Since then, playlists, streaming platforms, and short form video have shifted what
        a chart-topping song sounds like, how long it runs, and how it moves.
        This project looks at recent decades of Billboard year end entries paired with Spotify audio features
        and asks a simple design question about music: if "Breathe" came out in the current landscape,
        would it still have the shape of a hit.

      <h2 class="chapter-title">Three eras of the hit song</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Before isolating a single track, it helps to zoom out. The chart to the right compresses several
        eras of pop into three average tempo groups. It turns a large archive of singles into a simple
        view of how fast hits tended to move at different moments.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        In the early 2000s, charting tracks often leaned toward punchy radio pop and country ballads.
        In the 2010s, EDM and trap coexist with quieter ballads, and the average tempo begins to fall.
        In more recent years, hits settle into a mid tempo range that fits long playlists and background
        listening on streaming platforms.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        This pattern aligns with commentary from Spotify and Billboard, who note that the shift from
        radio to streaming changed what listeners expect from a hit. Instead of standing out with high
        intensity, many modern singles are designed to blend smoothly into continuous listening.
      </p>

      <div class="chapter-note">
        <p>
          "Breathe" comes from that first era. Its tempo fits well there, but the average hit around it
          has shifted as listening habits changed.

      <h2 class="chapter-title">When the pulse of pop drifts downward</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Tempo is one of the clearest points of contrast between "Breathe" and a typical recent hit.
        The chart shows a gradual decline in average BPM. While individual years spike upward during
        waves of club pop or EDM, the long trend moves downward.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        A 2019 Spotify report notes that many listeners now use playlists as ambient sound while
        working or commuting. This encourages steady mid tempo music rather than dramatic peaks.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Against that backdrop, "Breathe" reads as relatively brisk. Its tempo feels natural for
        early 2000s pop, but compared to recent hits it carries more lift and forward motion.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body" id="fh-tempo-note">
        Its tempo sits above most recent years in the dataset, placing it slightly outside the modern center.

      <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 3 / Length</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">How hits learned to take up less time</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Early 2000s singles often ran longer than four minutes. That suited radio and CD listening,
        where slower builds and extended choruses had room to land. Streaming shifts that logic.
        Industry reporting shows that shorter tracks tend to increase play counts and reduce skip rates.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        In this dataset, average track length falls over time. Labels and producers describe trimming
        intros, reducing repetition, and tightening structure to suit shorter attention spans and
        algorithmic recommendations.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        The marker for "Breathe" sits noticeably above the modern cluster. Its spacious structure feels
        intentional for its era but stands out today.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body" id="fh-length-note">
        In a landscape of shorter singles, its length feels deliberate and tied to another moment in pop.

      <h2 class="chapter-title">From loudness wars to leveled streams</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Through the 1990s and 2000s, mastering engineers pushed tracks louder to stand out on radio.
        Research on the loudness war documents rising compression and shrinking dynamic range during
        this period.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Streaming platforms later introduced loudness normalization targets, which reduce the advantage
        of extremely loud masters. Even so, many recent hits maintain dense production and strong
        transients to create a sense of impact.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        "Breathe" sits slightly softer than the modern average. This gives it more dynamic room for
        vocals and instrumentation. On normalized platforms it would sit comfortably but feel more
        open than many current pop or hip hop tracks.

      <h2 class="chapter-title">Intensity stays high while movement shifts</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Energy remains consistently strong across the dataset. Producers describe modern hits as dense
        and present, even when the tempo is moderate. This expectation of immediacy has remained stable.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Danceability varies more. Club oriented production lifts the average in some years, while
        stretches of singer songwriter and atmospheric pop reduce it. Analysts link these cycles to
        cultural trends such as social media rhythms and shifts in nightlife.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        "Breathe" lands firmly in the energy range but lower in danceability. It was written as a ballad,
        not a rhythm driven track. In a modern playlist it would likely sit among emotional or cinematic
        songs rather than dance heavy sections.

      <h2 class="chapter-title">Every style leaves a different audio fingerprint</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Grouping tracks by broad genre shows clear numerical differences.
        In this dataset, hip hop averages <strong>0.82</strong> danceability,
        rock averages <strong>0.78</strong> energy, and pop sits in the middle with
        energy near <strong>0.66</strong> and danceability near <strong>0.68</strong>.
        Country tracks average higher valence at <strong>0.56</strong>, driven by
        acoustic instrumentation and melodic storytelling.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Even as genre boundaries blur, these fingerprints remain measurable.
        Streaming analysis and music journalism note that hybrid pop still reveals
        its roots through rhythm, vocal delivery, and production style.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        "Breathe" sits between country and pop. Its acoustic layers, slower movement,
        and clear vocal mix match country pop patterns from the early 2000s.
        Compared to modern hits—which average <strong>0.73</strong> danceability,
        <strong>0.68</strong> energy, and <strong>0.45</strong> valence—it appears
        warmer, more narrative, and less rhythm-forward.

      <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 8 / Verdict</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">So, would "Breathe" still be a hit?</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        The final charts compare the structure of “Breathe” with the numerical
        center of modern hits. Recent songs average <strong>115 BPM</strong>,
        <strong>3.3 minutes</strong> in length, and around <strong>−3.8 dB</strong>
        in loudness. “Breathe” sits at <strong>136 BPM</strong>, runs
        <strong>4.15 minutes</strong>, and measures <strong>−7.2 dB</strong>.
        Structurally, it stands noticeably outside the 2020s cluster.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Emotionally, modern hits average <strong>0.68</strong> energy,
        <strong>0.73</strong> danceability, and <strong>0.45</strong> valence.
        “Breathe” is similar in energy (<strong>0.68</strong>) but moves less
        (<strong>0.52</strong> danceability) and carries a slightly higher valence
        (<strong>0.55</strong>) shaped by steel guitar and melodic arcs.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Researchers often describe hits as designed responses to their environment—
        radio constraints in 2000, algorithmic playlists today. Viewed through that
        lens, “Breathe” is a beautifully crafted early-2000s object. Dropping it
        directly into the present would likely make it feel nostalgic rather than
        contemporary, simply because the averages around it have shifted.
      </p>

      <div class="chapter-note">
        <p>
          A modern remix that trims the length, brightens the drums, and boosts
          low end could push it closer to today’s 0.73 danceability norm.
          The original remains a reminder that hits are shaped not only by data,
          but by mood, memory, and cultural moment.
