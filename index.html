        In 2000, Faith Hill's <span class="hero-song">"Breathe"</span> finished the year as the top song on the
        Billboard Hot 100. Since then, playlists, streaming platforms, and short form video have shifted what
        a chart-topping song sounds like, how long it runs, and how it moves.
        This project looks at recent decades of Billboard year end entries paired with Spotify audio features
        and asks a simple design question about music: if "Breathe" came out in the current landscape,
        would it still have the shape of a hit.

      <h2 class="chapter-title">Three eras of the hit song</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Before isolating one song, it helps to zoom out. The chart to the right compresses several
        eras of pop into three numbers: an average tempo for each broad decade slice in this dataset.
        It turns a messy archive of singles into a simple timeline of how fast hits tend to move.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        In the early 2000s, charting tracks often leaned toward punchy radio pop and country ballads
        with big choruses and strong drums. As we move into the 2010s, EDM peaks, trap beats, and
        ballads coexist in more complex ways, which nudges the average tempo downward. In the most recent
        years, hits often settle into a controlled mid tempo range that feels comfortable inside
        long playlists rather than a single radio moment.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        This framing draws on work by musicologists and industry writers who document how distribution
        channels shape sound. Analysts writing for Spotify and Billboard point out a broader shift from
        stand out radio singles toward smoother, more continuous listening experiences on streaming.
      </p>

      <div class="chapter-note">
        <p>
          "Breathe" comes from that first era. Its tempo feels very at home there, but the shape of
          the average hit has changed around it as listening habits evolved.

      <h2 class="chapter-title">When the pulse of pop drifts downward</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Tempo is one of the clearest points of contrast between "Breathe" and a typical recent hit.
        The line chart follows the average beats per minute of songs in this dataset over time,
        and the golden dot shows where "Breathe" would fall on that same timeline.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        The trend is not a perfect slide down. There are bumps when club pop, EDM, or uptempo
        dance crossovers lift the average again. Still, the long arc bends toward slightly slower
        tracks overall. A 2019 Spotify analysis notes that many listeners now use playlists as
        ambient sound while working or commuting, which encourages mid tempo, continuous music
        instead of sharp peaks (Spotify Research 2019).
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        In this context, "Breathe" reads as noticeably brisk. It does not feel fast in isolation,
        but against the softer curve of recent years it carries the urgency of an earlier radio era.
        The chord progression and vocal delivery amplify that feeling, making tempo part of a broader
        design choice about how present the song should feel in everyday listening.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body" id="fh-tempo-note">
        The tempo lands above many recent hits, which makes it feel a little more lifted than the current average.

      <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 3 / Length</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">How hits learned to take up less time</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Early 2000s singles often stretched past the four minute mark. That made sense for radio
        programming, power ballads, and CD listening, where a long emotional arc had room to breathe.
        On streaming platforms, the logic tilts in a different direction. Industry reporting highlights
        how shorter tracks can generate more plays and reduce skip rates (Billboard 2021; Music Business Worldwide 2020).
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        The chart shows the average track length over time. As streaming becomes dominant, the center of
        gravity shifts downward. Label executives describe cutting intros, shortening bridges, and reducing
        repetition to fit a landscape where attention is fragile and playback metrics matter.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        The marker for "Breathe" sits above that modern cluster. The slow build, extended chorus, and
        instrumental passages that made sense on radio now feel almost luxurious. The song invites you
        to stay with it instead of moving quickly to the next hook on a playlist.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 4 / Loudness</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">From loudness wars to leveled streams</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Loudness here refers to the overall perceived volume of a track, measured in decibels relative to
        digital full scale. For years, mastering engineers pushed songs louder to stand out on radio and CD.
        This escalation is documented widely in audio engineering literature, where researchers describe
        aggressive compression throughout the 1990s and 2000s (Vickers 2010; Katz 2007).
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Streaming platforms later introduced loudness normalization standards such as Spotify’s -14 LUFS target
        (Reiss 2016). In theory, this reduces the advantage of hyper loud masters. In practice, the aesthetic
        of density and punch still shapes many chart hits, which lean on strong transients and minimal quiet space.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        "Breathe" was not mastered to that extreme. In the chart, its loudness sits softer than many recent hits.
        That does not weaken the track. It simply leaves more dynamic room for the vocal to swell and the
        arrangement to breathe. In a normalized streaming context, it would sit comfortably, but next to modern
        pop and hip hop it would feel a little more open and less compressed.

      <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 5 / Energy and movement</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">Intensity stays high while movement shifts</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Across the timeline, energy remains consistently strong. That aligns with commentary from producers
        and critics who describe modern pop as thick, layered, and always present. Even as taste shifts,
        the expectation that a hit should feel immediate has stayed relatively stable.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Danceability behaves differently. Instead of climbing or dropping in a straight line, it moves in cycles.
        Moments shaped by club pop and electronic production raise the average, while periods centered on
        singer songwriter or atmospheric pop soften it again. Streaming analyses and music journalism describe
        these shifts as reflections of cultural trends, from dance floors to social media rhythms
        (Spotify Research 2020; Billboard 2022).
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        "Breathe" lands comfortably on the energy scale, but its danceability is more modest. It was written
        as a slow burn ballad rather than a track designed for challenges or loops. In a modern playlist,
        it would likely sit alongside other emotional or cinematic songs rather than in the heart of a dance set.
        The contrast does not weaken the song. It simply highlights how musical priorities drift over time.

      <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 6 / Mood drift</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">How pop brightness slides and wobbles</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Several studies in music psychology and industry reporting argue that mainstream music sounds
        less cheerful today than it did at the start of the century. Spotify's valence feature offers one
        way to see that trend numerically. Higher valence scores indicate brighter moods. Lower scores capture
        darker, more introspective, or bittersweet tones. Large scale datasets show a downward drift in
        average valence across mainstream pop (Interiano et al. 2018; Mauch et al. 2015).
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        The chart reflects that slow decline. Through the late 2000s and early 2010s, emo influenced hip hop,
        minor key electronic textures, and confessional pop move into the mainstream. Researchers writing in
        journals like Musicae Scientiae and popular outlets such as The Guardian highlight this shift toward
        sadder sounding hits.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        "Breathe" lands with a moderate valence. The lyrics describe comfort and intimacy, but the chords,
        steel guitar, and vocal delivery carry a quiet longing. It feels more like a slow dance at a wedding
        than a bright pop rush. The data shows where it sits on the spectrum, but it also reminds us that
        emotional experience is more complex than a single metric.

      <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 7 / Genres</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">Every style leaves a different audio fingerprint</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Grouping songs into broad genres reveals familiar patterns across the dataset. Hip hop tends to
        lean high on danceability, rock carries stronger average energy, and pop sits in a flexible middle
        space that shifts depending on the decade. Country blends acoustic textures with storytelling,
        often resulting in moderate energy and brightness.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Music journalism and streaming analysis frequently describe this blending of styles. Writers at
        Pitchfork, Billboard, and The New York Times have noted that genre boundaries have softened, but the
        underlying fingerprints remain visible. Even in an era of hybrid pop, rhythmic choices, production
        style, and vocal delivery still signal where a song comes from.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        "Breathe" sits at the intersection of country and pop. Its steel guitar, acoustic layers, and narrative
        structure point toward country, while the polish and vocal phrasing align it with early 2000s crossover
        pop. In the genre comparison chart, it aligns closest to the pattern of country pop from its era, which
        now lives slightly outside a space dominated by hip hop influenced and rhythm forward hits. Critics note
        that while genres blend, the core fingerprints remain consistent (New York Times 2019; Pitchfork 2021).

      <h2 class="chapter-title">So, would "Breathe" still be a hit?</h2>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        The final charts pull everything together. Instead of asking only whether the song is good,
        they ask how its musical structure and emotional profile align with the center of the modern
        hit cluster. The first chart compares tempo, length, and loudness. The second compares energy,
        danceability, valence, and acousticness.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        On nearly every dimension, "Breathe" sits a little to the side of the contemporary average.
        It is faster than many recent hits, longer than most, quieter in mastering terms, and more
        acoustic in its instrumentation. Its emotional tone is steady and heartfelt rather than bright,
        ironic, or heavily melancholic. None of this weakens the song. It simply reflects the design
        priorities of a different media environment.
      </p>

      <p class="chapter-body">
        Researchers and critics often describe hits as designed objects shaped by constraints:
        radio formatting, label strategy, loudness standards, streaming algorithms, and even social
        media rhythms. Through that lens, "Breathe" is a beautifully crafted early 2000s object. Dropping
        it directly into the present would make it feel nostalgic, almost like a time capsule from a slower
        and more linear listening era.
      </p>

      <div class="chapter-note">
        <p>
          A modern remix that trims the length, brightens the drums, and leans into current low end
          and rhythm choices might travel further on streaming platforms. The original version, though,
          still works as a reminder that a hit is not only a pattern in the data. It is also memory,
          mood, and cultural moment.
