        In 2000, Faith Hill's <span class="hero-song">"Breathe"</span> finished the year as the top song on the
        Billboard Hot 100. Since then, streaming platforms, playlists, and TikTok
        have pulled the sound of a hit in new directions. This project looks at
        twenty four years of Billboard entries paired with Spotify audio features
        to ask a simple question: if "Breathe" came out today, would it still climb to number one?

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Before comparing one song to the present day, it helps to understand
            how the sound of a typical hit has shifted over time. The chart on the
            right compresses the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s into three numbers:
            average tempo for each decade.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            In the early two thousands, charting tracks leaned into higher energy
            radio pop. The following decade saw a slight cooling as EDM peaks
            mixed with slower hip hop and ballads. By the 2020s, hits settle into
            a slightly slower and more controlled range that works well for
            playlists and background listening.
          </p>
          <div class="chapter-note">
            <p>
              "Breathe" was written for that first decade climate. Its tempo sits
              above the average even for the 2000s.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Tempo is one of the clearest differences between "Breathe" and many
            present day hits. The line chart tracks the average beats per minute
            for songs in this dataset from 2000 to 2024. The golden dot marks the
            tempo of "Breathe" in that landscape.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            The trend is not a straight line downward. There are bumps around the
            mid two thousands and early two thousand tens when dance pop and EDM
            pulled averages higher. But the general direction is toward slightly
            slower songs, which fit well into long playlists and looping streams.

            Early two thousands singles often ran longer than four minutes, a

          <h2 class="chapter-title">The long fight for loudness plateaus</h2>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            For years mastering engineers pushed tracks louder to stand out on
            radio and CD. This practice, often called the loudness war, filled
            waves with dense and compressed mixes. Streaming platforms later added
            volume normalization, which levels playback, but the aesthetic of
            high impact, high density sound remains.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            "Breathe" was not mastered as aggressively as many recent hits. In a
            normalized streaming context it would still be audible, but its softer
            profile might feel less immediate next to modern pop and hip hop.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Spotify's energy and danceability measures describe how intense a track
            feels and how easy it is to move to it. This dual line chart follows
            both values across time. The two golden points show where "Breathe"
            lands on each scale.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Energy levels have stayed fairly strong across the period, but
            danceability rises in the 2010s as rhythmic hip hop and electronic
            pop dominate the charts. "Breathe" has respectable energy yet more
            modest danceability compared to many recent songs designed for clubs,
            challenges, and short form video.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Several studies argue that popular music sounds less positive today
            than it did at the start of the century. Spotify's valence feature
            offers a way to see that shift numerically. Higher values indicate
            brighter, more cheerful sounding songs.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            The line on the right leans downward through the late two thousands
            and early two thousand tens, when emo influenced hip hop, darker
            electronic textures, and introspective pop move to the center of the
            charts. "Breathe" sits on the upper side of that scale, which would
            make it stand out as unusually optimistic in many modern playlists.

            Grouping the dataset into broad genres reveals familiar patterns.
            Hip hop leans high in danceability. Rock carries stronger average

            Faith Hill's song blends country and pop traits. It fits the energy

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Would "Breathe" still be a hit?</h2>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            The final two charts bring everything together. The first compares the
            musical structure of "Breathe" against the typical 2020s hit. The
            second compares their emotional profile: energy, danceability, mood,
            and acousticness.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            On nearly every dimension, "Breathe" sits to the side of the cluster.
            It is faster, longer, quieter, and more acoustic. It is also brighter
            and slightly less dance focused than many current number ones. That
            does not mean the song is weak. It means that the market around it has
            moved.
          </p>
          <div class="chapter-note">
            <p>
              The original version would likely feel nostalgic rather than
              contemporary if it appeared on the charts today. A remix that trims
              the length, boosts loudness, and leans into modern drum and bass
              choices might have a better shot at repeating its earlier success.
