        In 2000, Faith Hill's <span class="hero-song">"Breathe"</span> finished the year as the top song on the
        Billboard Hot 100. Since then, playlists, streaming platforms, and short form video have shifted what
        a chart-topping song sounds like, how long it runs, and how it moves.
        This project looks at recent decades of Billboard year end entries paired with Spotify audio features
        and asks a simple design question about music: if "Breathe" came out in the current landscape,
        would it still have the shape of a hit.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Three eras of the hit song</h2>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            Before isolating one song, it helps to zoom out. The chart to the right compresses several
            eras of pop into three numbers: an average tempo for each broad decade slice in this dataset.
            It turns a messy archive of singles into a simple timeline of how fast hits tend to move.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            In the early 2000s, charting tracks often leaned toward punchy radio pop and country ballads
            with big choruses and strong drums. As we move into the 2010s, EDM peaks, trap beats, and
            ballads coexist in more complex ways, so the average tempo cools slightly. In the most recent
            years, songs often settle into a controlled, mid tempo range that feels comfortable inside
            long playlists rather than a single radio moment.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            This framing borrows from work by musicologists and industry writers who note how distribution
            channels shape sound. Analysts writing for Spotify and Billboard describe a shift from
            stand out moments on radio to smoother, more continuous listening experiences on streaming.
          </p>
          <div class="chapter-note">
            <p>
              "Breathe" comes from that first era. Its tempo feels very at home there, but the shape of
              the average hit has changed around it.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">When the pulse of pop drifts downward</h2>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            Tempo is one of the clearest points of contrast between "Breathe" and a typical recent hit.
            The line chart follows the average beats per minute of songs in this dataset over time.
            The golden dot marks where "Breathe" would sit on that same timeline.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            The trend is not a perfect slide down. There are bumps when club pop, EDM, or uptempo
            dance crossovers pull the average up again. Still, the long arc bends toward slightly slower
            tracks. A 2019 Spotify analysis of listening habits notes how people often use playlists as
            ambient sound while working or commuting, which rewards mid tempo, continuous music rather
            than constant peaks.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            In this context, "Breathe" reads as noticeably brisk. It does not feel fast in isolation,
            but against the softer curve of recent years it carries the urgency of an earlier radio era.
            The chord progression and vocal delivery reinforce that feeling, so the tempo becomes part of
            a broader design choice about how forward the song should sit in the mix of everyday life.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body" id="fh-tempo-note">

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Early 2000s singles regularly stretched past the four minute mark. That made sense for radio
            programming, power ballads, and CD listening, where a long emotional arc felt satisfying.
            On streaming platforms, the logic tilts in a different direction. Shorter tracks can generate
            more plays in the same listening window, and listeners can skip at any moment.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            The chart shows the average track length in minutes. Over time, the center of gravity moves downward.
            Reports on streaming strategy, including coverage in Billboard and interviews with label executives,
            describe how artists and producers have adjusted intros, shortened bridges, and trimmed repetition
            to fit this new economy of attention.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            The marker for "Breathe" sits above that modern cluster. The slow build, extended chorus, and
            instrumental passages that made sense on radio now feel almost luxurious. The song invites you to
            stay with it, instead of cycling quickly to the next hook on a playlist.

          <p class="chapter-kicker">Chapter 4 / Loudness</p>
          <h2 class="chapter-title">From loudness wars to levelled streams</h2>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            Loudness here refers to the overall perceived volume of a track, measured in decibels relative to
            digital full scale. For years, mastering engineers pushed songs louder to stand out on radio and CD,
            a phenomenon often called the loudness war. Academic work in audio engineering and articles in
            Sound on Sound and other trade publications describe how this arms race led to heavily compressed,
            high impact mixes.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            Streaming platforms later introduced loudness normalization, which turns everything up or down
            to a consistent level. In theory, this reduces the advantage of hyper loud masters. In practice,
            the aesthetic of density and punch still shapes a lot of chart music. Many current hits are mastered
            with strong transients and very little quiet space.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            "Breathe" was not mastered to that extreme. On the chart, its loudness sits a bit softer than many
            recent hits. That does not mean it feels weak. It means there is more dynamic room for the vocal to
            swell and the arrangement to breathe, which fits the song's emotional tone. In a normalized streaming
            context, it would still sit comfortably, but next to recent pop and hip hop it might feel slightly
            more open and less crushed.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Intensity stays high while movement shifts</h2>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            Spotify's energy and danceability scores offer a useful lens for how a track feels in the body.
            Energy captures perceived intensity, from gentle ballad to full throttle, while danceability reflects
            how easy it is to move to the rhythm. The dual line chart follows both values across this dataset.
            Two golden points show where "Breathe" lands on each scale.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            Energy levels stay relatively high across the years, which matches commentary from producers
            and critics who describe the modern pop landscape as dense and saturated.
            Danceability, however, rises as hip hop, trap, and rhythm forward electronic pop move to the center
            of the charts. A number of Spotify research posts and music journalism pieces point out how
            four on the floor kicks and steady grooves support club play and TikTok choreography.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            "Breathe" has solid energy, but its danceability is more modest. It is written as a slow burn ballad
            rather than a track built for challenges or loops. That difference shows up visually here,
            and it is also easy to feel when you imagine where the song might appear in a modern playlist:
            probably near other emotional, cinematic songs, not in the heart of a dance or workout set.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Several studies in music psychology and industry reporting argue that mainstream music sounds
            less obviously cheerful today than it did at the start of the century. Spotify's valence feature
            offers one way to see that trend numerically. Higher valence scores indicate brighter, more
            positive sounding songs. Lower scores capture moods that feel darker, more introspective, or bittersweet.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            The line shows the average valence of songs in this dataset over time. It drifts downward through
            the late 2000s and early 2010s as emo influenced hip hop, minor key electronic textures, and
            confessional pop move into the mainstream. Researchers writing in journals like <em>Musicae Scientiae</em>
            and popular outlets such as The Guardian have pointed to this slow tilt toward sadder sounding hits.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            "Breathe" does not sit at the top of the brightness scale. Spotify's analysis gives it a more moderate
            valence. That makes sense when you listen closely. The lyrics describe comfort and intimacy, but the chords,
            steel guitar, and vocal delivery carry a sense of longing. It feels like a prom slow dance or a wedding
            moment rather than a sugar rush. The data helps show this balance, but it also reminds us that emotional
            experience is more complex than a single metric.

            Grouping songs into broad genres reveals familiar patterns. Hip hop tends to lean high on danceability.
            Rock often carries stronger average energy. Pop lands in the middle with flexible moods.
            Country blends acoustic instrumentation with storytelling and melodic hooks.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Music journalism and streaming platform insights often highlight the same story. Writers at places like
            Pitchfork, Billboard, and The New York Times describe how the boundaries between these genres have softened,
            but the core fingerprints still remain. Hip hop and pop borrow from each other, yet the rhythmic and

          <p class="chapter-body">
            "Breathe" sits at the intersection of country and pop. The acoustic instruments and storytelling lean
            toward country, while the structure and polish feel like mainstream crossover pop. In the genre comparison,
            it lands closest to the early 2000s country pop pattern, which now sits off to the side of a field

          <h2 class="chapter-title">So, would "Breathe" still be a hit?</h2>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            The last two charts bring everything together in a designerly way. Instead of asking only
            whether a song is good, they ask how its structure and emotional profile align with the center
            of the current hit cluster. One chart compares tempo, length, and loudness. The other compares
            energy, danceability, valence, and acousticness.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            On nearly every dimension, "Breathe" sits a little to the side. It is faster than many recent hits,
            longer than most, quieter in mastering terms, and more acoustic in instrumentation.
            Emotionally, it is steady and heartfelt rather than relentlessly bright or aggressively dark.
            This does not weaken the song. It simply marks it as a product of a different media environment.
          </p>
          <p class="chapter-body">
            Researchers and critics often remind us that hits are designed objects shaped by constraints:
            radio format, label expectations, streaming algorithms, and social media trends.
            Read through that lens, "Breathe" is a beautifully crafted early 2000s object.
            Dropping it into the present without changes would probably make it feel nostalgic,
            almost like a time capsule of a slower, more linear listening experience.

              A modern remix that trims the length, brightens the drum sound, and leans into current low end
              and rhythm choices might travel further on streaming platforms and social feeds.
              The original, though, still works as a reminder that a hit is not only a set of numbers.
              It is also a memory, a mood, and a moment in time.
