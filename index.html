        Would Faith Hill<br />
        <span class="hero-highlight">Still Be a Hit?</span>
      </h1>

      <p class="hero-lede">
        In 2000, Faith Hill’s <span class="hero-song">"Breathe"</span> finished as the top song of the year. 
        Two decades later, the landscape of popular music looks different. Streaming platforms, algorithmic playlists, 
        and TikTok trends have reshaped what rises to the top. Using Billboard year-end charts paired with Spotify audio features, 
        this project asks a simple question with a complicated answer: if “Breathe” were released today, would it still become a hit?

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Before comparing one song to the present, it helps to understand the broader arc. 
            The chart on the right reduces almost three decades of music into a simple view: 
            average tempo across the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.
          </p>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Early 2000s hits leaned into energetic radio pop. The 2010s introduced a mix of EDM surges 
            and slower hip hop trends. By the 2020s, the sound settles into something steadier and often more restrained, 
            shaped by playlists and passive listening environments.
          </p>

          <div class="chapter-note">
            <p>
              “Breathe” was written for the energy of the early 2000s. Even within its own decade, it runs fast.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Popular music slows its pace</h2>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Tempo is one of the clearest differences between “Breathe” and many modern hits. 
            The chart follows average BPM from 2000 to 2024. The highlighted point marks where 
            “Breathe” would sit today.
          </p>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            The line doesn’t fall smoothly. It bumps during EDM spikes in the mid-2000s and early 2010s, 
            but the long-term trend points toward slightly slower, more groove-driven songs designed 
            for continuous streaming rather than radio rotation.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Hit songs keep shrinking</h2>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            In the early 2000s, four-minute ballads and pop anthems dominated radio. 
            Streaming changed the incentive structure. Shorter songs generate more plays in the same amount of time, 
            and more plays mean more visibility on algorithmic charts.
          </p>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            The chart tracks average song length over time. “Breathe,” at over four minutes, 
            now sits far outside the modern norm.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">The loudness war levels off</h2>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            For decades, mastering engineers pushed tracks louder to stand out on radio and CDs, 
            leading to what became known as the loudness war. Streaming services introduced 
            playback normalization, blunting the incentive to boost volume.
          </p>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            “Breathe” arrives from a pre-normalization era. Compared with current hits, 
            it sits on the softer end of the spectrum. Not inaudible, but less forceful than many modern mixes.

            Spotify’s energy metric reflects intensity. Danceability measures rhythmic clarity and ease of movement.
            The dual chart tracks both over time, revealing consistent energy but rising danceability 
            as hip hop and electronic pop take center stage.
          </p>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            “Breathe” carries strong early-2000s energy but modest danceability compared to today’s

            Valence is Spotify’s proxy for musical positivity. Across the 2000s and 2010s, 
            average valence trends downward as darker textures, introspective lyrics, 
            and moodier production move into mainstream pop.

          <p class="chapter-body">
            On this scale, “Breathe” appears warmer and brighter than many modern hits —

            Grouping the dataset by broad genres reveals distinct patterns: hip hop tends toward high danceability,

          <p class="chapter-body">
            “Breathe” reflects that early-2000s country-pop blend. But today’s charts skew toward 
            hybrid pop and hip hop sounds, making its production feel like a throwback.

          <h2 class="chapter-title">Would “Breathe” chart today?</h2>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            The final comparison brings everything together. The first chart aligns musical structure: 
            tempo, loudness, and length. The second compares emotional and production traits: 
            energy, danceability, brightness, and acousticness.
          </p>

          <p class="chapter-body">
            Across the board, “Breathe” sits outside the cluster of modern hits. 
            It is faster, longer, quieter, and more acoustic. It is also brighter and slightly less rhythm-centered. 
            None of these qualities make it worse — they simply make it from a different era.
          </p>

          <div class="chapter-note">
            <p>
              A faithful re-release today might feel nostalgic rather than contemporary. 
              A remix that trims length, boosts loudness, and updates its rhythm might have a stronger shot 
              at repeating its earlier success.
